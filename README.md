so ill convert it to one css , that call thestyle.css
for the concept page , ill update it so it only show what our imperial suites offers , dont need use the vision & mission so on , only features and the offers 
for the gallery page , ill already reduce the size and make it looks tidy , so i use row and column to arrange it and ill already create the hyperlinks to your page , change the design
for the mortgage done , just copy paste the code from previous file and it looks ok and fit enough
for the contact , ill add some locations and the contact info , also ill remove the 2 sub-unit that didnt have function which is the apartment & single type room choice also at the mainpage got hyperlinks to your page , and ill change the design
